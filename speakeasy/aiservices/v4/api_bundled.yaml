      description: |
        The Retrieve API enables enterprises to directly access relevant content chunks from their organizational knowledge sources. It is designed for scenarios where developers want granular control over retrieved information, such as powering custom search, analytics, or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines. 

        The Retrieve API's response will either be a Certified Answer or a list of chunks.
        - **Certified Answers Response**: This response is observed when there's a matching certified answer to the user's query.
        - **Chunk List Response**: This response is observed, if there is no matched Certified Answer.

        Responses for both chunks and certified answers include relevance scores and metadata. By leveraging the Retrieve API, organizations can build tailored experiences while retaining confidence in the source material.

                      | A |  |
                      | Account | A type of financial property or financial obligation that is held and owned under your name. When you open a financial account—whether it’s a checking account, savings account, CD or money market account—you have certain rights and responsibilities as an account holder. |
                      | Account balance | The total amount of all funds in your account. |
                      | ACH (Automated Clearing House) | ACH is a type of electronic funds transfer system that operates between banks, businesses and individual consumers in a nationwide network. Banks use ACH payments to move money between them. When you sign up for direct deposit of your paycheck at work, that money often moves into your bank account via ACH. |
                      | Adjustable rate | A rate of interest that can vary during the term of the loan. Usually used when referring to mortgages. |
                      | Annual percentage rate (APR) | The interest rate and fees or additional costs you’re charged per year for a loan or credit card. For you as a customer, a lower rate is always better. |
                      | Annual percentage yield (APY) | The effective annual rate of return taking into account the compounding of interest on a savings, checking, CD or money market account. On this rate, the higher the better. |
                      | APR (Annual Percentage Rate) | The total annualized cost of a loan. When you borrow money, whether it’s via a credit card, car loan or another loan, the lender is required to disclose the APR, so you understand the full cost of borrowing the money. |
                      | APY (Annual Percentage Yield) | The annual yield earned on a deposit account, such as a savings, money market or CD account. Savers can use APY as one of several factors to help determine which savings options are the best. |
                      | Assets | Any personal possessions of value. This also includes cash, real estate and investments. |
                      | ATM (Automated Teller Machine) | A convenient location for basic banking transactions, such as withdrawing cash, depositing checks or making balance inquiries. Many banks offer access to a network of fee-free ATMs. |
                      | ATM fees | Fees you’re charged for using an out-of-network ATM or exceeding a certain number of ATM transactions for your account, if limited. |
                      | Auto loan | A loan for the purchase of a vehicle you pay off over time. This is more expensive than buying a car outright since you’re paying interest, but you also get to use the car while you’re paying for it. |
                      | Automated clearing house (ACH) | The electronic network used to transfer money between accounts at different institutions. |
                      | Automated Teller Machine (ATM) card | A card that gives you access to your account through an ATM. If it’s a debit card, it will also work at retailers. |

                      | Account balance | The total amount of all funds in your account. |
                      | ACH (Automated Clearing House) | ACH is a type of electronic funds transfer system that operates between banks, businesses and individual consumers in a nationwide network. Banks use ACH payments to move money between them. When you sign up for direct deposit of your paycheck at work, that money often moves into your bank account via ACH. |
                      | Adjustable rate | A rate of interest that can vary during the term of the loan. Usually used when referring to mortgages. |
                      | Annual percentage rate (APR) | The interest rate and fees or additional costs you’re charged per year for a loan or credit card. For you as a customer, a lower rate is always better. |
                      | Annual percentage yield (APY) | The effective annual rate of return taking into account the compounding of interest on a savings, checking, CD or money market account. On this rate, the higher the better. |
                      | APR (Annual Percentage Rate) | The total annualized cost of a loan. When you borrow money, whether it’s via a credit card, car loan or another loan, the lender is required to disclose the APR, so you understand the full cost of borrowing the money. |
                      | APY (Annual Percentage Yield) | The annual yield earned on a deposit account, such as a savings, money market or CD account. Savers can use APY as one of several factors to help determine which savings options are the best. |
                      | Assets | Any personal possessions of value. This also includes cash, real estate and investments. |
                      | ATM (Automated Teller Machine) | A convenient location for basic banking transactions, such as withdrawing cash, depositing checks or making balance inquiries. Many banks offer access to a network of fee-free ATMs. |

                      | Auto loan | A loan for the purchase of a vehicle you pay off over time. This is more expensive than buying a car outright since you’re paying interest, but you also get to use the car while you’re paying for it. |

                      | Automated Teller Machine (ATM) card | A card that gives you access to your account through an ATM. If it’s a debit card, it will also work at retailers. |

                    snippet: This is the repayment period of a loan during which payments of both principal and interest are required to be made to pay down the balance on the loan according to the terms of the loan documents prior to its maturity date. The amortization period may vary by the loan product and whether the loan has an interest-only period. For example, a 30-year fixed rate mortgage loan, which requires principal and interest payments from the beginning, has a 30-year amortization period.

                      | Conditions | Also known as terms and conditions, this is the fine print of a bank account or loan agreement. Make sure you read and understand the implications of your financial accounts and obligations. |
                      | Credit | An increase in a savings or checking account, such as a deposit made to the account. 2. A person or company’s ability to borrow money, with the expectation the money will be paid back in the future. |
                      | Credit card | One of the most popular forms of credit, a card that allows you to spend up to a specific limit. Interest on the balance is assessed at the end of the monthly term, so to avoid paying any interest pay off your full balance each month. |
                      | Credit limit | The maximum amount you’re allowed to charge on a credit card or HELOC. Once you’ve shown a habit of paying bills consistently on time, a lender may raise your credit limit—giving you more spending power. |
                      | Credit rating | An evaluation of credit worthiness based on financial resources and credit history. Strictly speaking, ratings are usually applied to businesses or governments and expressed as a letter grade (A, B+, etc.) |
                      | Credit score | In contrast to a credit rating, the credit score is a number (600, 700, etc.) indicating an individual's credit-worthiness. Credit bureaus look at factors such as your total debt, number of open accounts and whether you rent or own your home. A good credit score can result in a lower interest rate for loans. |
                      | Credit/credit history/credit score | Credit generally refers to your ability to borrow—the willingness of banks and other lenders to extend a loan to you. If you have a strong credit history, that means you have a proven track record of paying bills on time and paying your debts. Your credit score is a measure of creditworthiness based, in part, on your credit history. Having a higher credit score can help you qualify for a lower interest on loans, better credit terms, larger loan amounts and higher credit limits. |
                      | Current balance | The amount of funds in your account, including any pending activity. |
                      | D |  |
                      | Debit | A decrease in a savings or checking account, such as a withdrawal or a check written against the account. |
                      | Debit card | An ATM card that allows you to pay for goods at stores or businesses, online, and at ATMs. A debit card draws the money from your checking account, in contrast to a credit card where you’re borrowing the money and have to pay it back later. |
                      | Deposit | Funds added to your account. |
                      | Direct deposit | An automatic deposit to your account made by your employer or an outside agency (such as a pension or government benefit payment). These are usually recurring and spare you the hassle of depositing a paper check. Online transfers are not considered direct deposits. |
                      | E |  |
                      | Early withdrawal penalty | A fee for withdrawing funds from an account—or closing it—before its maturity date. This applies to CDs and individual retirement accounts (IRAs). |
                      | eBills | Electronic bills that are delivered directly to your online banking account for payment instead of being mailed to your home. |
                      | Electronic check presentment (ECP) | An electronic image of a check that can be processed by banks and clearing houses instead of the actual paper check. |

                      | Interest | The cost of borrowing money or the amount earned on a deposit account. To calculate simple interest, multiply the original amount (of your savings or your loan) by the interest rate. For compound interest, the interest is added to the total amount as it accumulates. |

                      | Interest rate | The annual percentage paid on an interest-bearing savings account or CD, or the interest charged on loans. The interest paid on a deposit account is the "annual percentage yield" (APY) and the rate charged on a loan is the "annual percentage rate" (APR). |
                      | Interest transfer | A process that allows interest earned on one account to be transferred to another account. For example, the interest earned on a CD can be transferred to a money market account. |

Common types of investments include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, index funds, exchange traded funds and real estate. There are also various alternative investments like gold, commodities, fine art, wine and more. Unlike bank savings and checking accounts, investments are not FDIC insured and have a risk of loss. |

                      | Joint account | An account with two or more owners that own the account equally, with the same rights and obligations of using the account. For example, many married couples have a joint checking account that allows them both to write checks and make deposits into the same shared account. |
                      | M |  |
                      | Maturity date | This is the date of expiration for the contractual obligation of a financial instrument. For example, certificates of deposit have a maturity date that depends on the length of the CD term. When the CD matures, you have the option to withdraw the money. Some banks and credit unions also allow you to roll it into a new CD or enable the CD to renew automatically. |
                      | Micro-deposits | Small deposits (usually a dollar or two) made to verify an account you’re trying to link. Once verified, you can use the account you’ve linked to your bank account for actions such as money transfers. Micro-deposits are usually reversed so there’s no permanent change in your balance. See also: EDV |
                      | Minimum balance | The amount your average balance in a deposit account must stay above to avoid fees. |
                      | Money market account | A high-yield savings account that’s FDIC-insured up to $250,000. In contrast to a CD, with a money market account, you can still have regular access to your funds. |

                      | Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) | A line of credit based on the estimated value of your home, or on the amount of equity in your home. |
                      | Home Equity Loan | A type of loan that uses the equity of your home as collateral. Typically, a home equity loan allows you to borrow a one-time lump-sum amount of money equal to or less than the equity you have in your home. |
                      | I |  |
                      | Indexed rate | The rate charged for an adjustable rate loan, such as a HELOC, mortgage or credit card. |
                      | Insufficient funds | An account balance too low to cover a check presented for payment. Sometimes abbreviated as NSF for "non-sufficient funds." |
                      | Interest | The cost of borrowing money or the amount earned on a deposit account. To calculate simple interest, multiply the original amount (of your savings or your loan) by the interest rate. For compound interest, the interest is added to the total amount as it accumulates. |
                      | Interest income | Your earnings on savings accounts, certificates of deposit and money markets. Banks or other organizations or individuals who pay interest usually report it on Form 1099-INT. |
                      | Interest rate | The annual percentage paid on an interest-bearing savings account or CD, or the interest charged on loans. The interest paid on a deposit account is the "annual percentage yield" (APY) and the rate charged on a loan is the "annual percentage rate" (APR). |
                      | Interest transfer | A process that allows interest earned on one account to be transferred to another account. For example, the interest earned on a CD can be transferred to a money market account. |
                      | Investments | Investments are financial assets that are purchased and sold by investors, with the goal of earning a return on investment (ROI). Common types of investments include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, index funds, exchange traded funds and real estate. There are also various alternative investments like gold, commodities, fine art, wine and more. Unlike bank savings and checking accounts, investments are not FDIC insured and have a risk of loss. |
                      | J |  |
                      | Joint account | An account with two or more owners that own the account equally, with the same rights and obligations of using the account. For example, many married couples have a joint checking account that allows them both to write checks and make deposits into the same shared account. |
                      | M |  |
                      | Maturity date | This is the date of expiration for the contractual obligation of a financial instrument. For example, certificates of deposit have a maturity date that depends on the length of the CD term. When the CD matures, you have the option to withdraw the money. Some banks and credit unions also allow you to roll it into a new CD or enable the CD to renew automatically. |
                      | Micro-deposits | Small deposits (usually a dollar or two) made to verify an account you’re trying to link. Once verified, you can use the account you’ve linked to your bank account for actions such as money transfers. Micro-deposits are usually reversed so there’s no permanent change in your balance. See also: EDV |
                      | Minimum balance | The amount your average balance in a deposit account must stay above to avoid fees. |
                      | Money market account | A high-yield savings account that’s FDIC-insured up to $250,000. In contrast to a CD, with a money market account, you can still have regular access to your funds. |

                      | Conditions | Also known as terms and conditions, this is the fine print of a bank account or loan agreement. Make sure you read and understand the implications of your financial accounts and obligations. |
                      | Credit | An increase in a savings or checking account, such as a deposit made to the account. 2. A person or company’s ability to borrow money, with the expectation the money will be paid back in the future. |
                      | Credit card | One of the most popular forms of credit, a card that allows you to spend up to a specific limit. Interest on the balance is assessed at the end of the monthly term, so to avoid paying any interest pay off your full balance each month. |
                      | Credit limit | The maximum amount you’re allowed to charge on a credit card or HELOC. Once you’ve shown a habit of paying bills consistently on time, a lender may raise your credit limit—giving you more spending power. |
                      | Credit rating | An evaluation of credit worthiness based on financial resources and credit history. Strictly speaking, ratings are usually applied to businesses or governments and expressed as a letter grade (A, B+, etc.) |
                      | Credit score | In contrast to a credit rating, the credit score is a number (600, 700, etc.) indicating an individual's credit-worthiness. Credit bureaus look at factors such as your total debt, number of open accounts and whether you rent or own your home. A good credit score can result in a lower interest rate for loans. |
                      | Credit/credit history/credit score | Credit generally refers to your ability to borrow—the willingness of banks and other lenders to extend a loan to you. If you have a strong credit history, that means you have a proven track record of paying bills on time and paying your debts. Your credit score is a measure of creditworthiness based, in part, on your credit history. Having a higher credit score can help you qualify for a lower interest on loans, better credit terms, larger loan amounts and higher credit limits. |

                      | Debit card | An ATM card that allows you to pay for goods at stores or businesses, online, and at ATMs. A debit card draws the money from your checking account, in contrast to a credit card where you’re borrowing the money and have to pay it back later. |
                      | Deposit | Funds added to your account. |
                      | Direct deposit | An automatic deposit to your account made by your employer or an outside agency (such as a pension or government benefit payment). These are usually recurring and spare you the hassle of depositing a paper check. Online transfers are not considered direct deposits. |
                      | E |  |
                      | Early withdrawal penalty | A fee for withdrawing funds from an account—or closing it—before its maturity date. This applies to CDs and individual retirement accounts (IRAs). |
                      | eBills | Electronic bills that are delivered directly to your online banking account for payment instead of being mailed to your home. |
                      | Electronic check presentment (ECP) | An electronic image of a check that can be processed by banks and clearing houses instead of the actual paper check. |

                      **Prequalification**

                      The Banker collects estimates of your income and liabilities to determine what mortgage products may be available to you and what you can afford to borrow. Our Mortgage Bankers can prequalify you by phone, in some cases. It normally takes 15 to 20 minutes and the applicant will receive a prequalification letter.

                      **Preapproval**

                      This is a more thorough review of your creditworthiness. We verify not only your credit, but also your income, assets and liabilities. Further, you will need to submit documentation such as proof of income, assets and debt records. The process can take 20 minutes if you come prepared, or in some cases up to 2 business days.

The amortization period may vary by the loan product and whether the loan has an interest-only period. For example, a 30-year fixed rate mortgage loan, which requires principal and interest payments from the beginning, has a 30-year amortization period.

                          | Adjustable rate | A rate of interest that can vary during the term of the loan. Usually used when referring to mortgages. |
                          | Annual percentage rate (APR) | The interest rate and fees or additional costs you’re charged per year for a loan or credit card. For you as a customer, a lower rate is always better. |
                          | Annual percentage yield (APY) | The effective annual rate of return taking into account the compounding of interest on a savings, checking, CD or money market account. On this rate, the higher the better. |
                          | APR (Annual Percentage Rate) | The total annualized cost of a loan. When you borrow money, whether it’s via a credit card, car loan or another loan, the lender is required to disclose the APR, so you understand the full cost of borrowing the money. |
                          | APY (Annual Percentage Yield) | The annual yield earned on a deposit account, such as a savings, money market or CD account. Savers can use APY as one of several factors to help determine which savings options are the best. |
                          | Assets | Any personal possessions of value. This also includes cash, real estate and investments. |

                          | Automated clearing house (ACH) | The electronic network used to transfer money between accounts at different institutions. |
                          | Automated Teller Machine (ATM) card | A card that gives you access to your account through an ATM. If it’s a debit card, it will also work at retailers. |

Credit bureaus look at factors such as your total debt, number of open accounts and whether you rent or own your home. A good credit score can result in a lower interest rate for loans. |
                          | Credit/credit history/credit score | Credit generally refers to your ability to borrow—the willingness of banks and other lenders to extend a loan to you. If you have a strong credit history, that means you have a proven track record of paying bills on time and paying your debts. Your credit score is a measure of creditworthiness based, in part, on your credit history. Having a higher credit score can help you qualify for a lower interest on loans, better credit terms, larger loan amounts and higher credit limits. |

                          | Debit card | An ATM card that allows you to pay for goods at stores or businesses, online, and at ATMs. A debit card draws the money from your checking account, in contrast to a credit card where you’re borrowing the money and have to pay it back later. |
                          | Deposit | Funds added to your account. |
                          | Direct deposit | An automatic deposit to your account made by your employer or an outside agency (such as a pension or government benefit payment).

                          | Early withdrawal penalty | A fee for withdrawing funds from an account—or closing it—before its maturity date. This applies to CDs and individual retirement accounts (IRAs). |

                        snippet: "# What are some examples of discriminatory lending practices?\n\nA lender commits discriminatory lending practices when he or she acts in one or more of the following manners:\n\n- Refuses to make a mortgage loan on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or disability; 7 8\n\n- Refuses to provide information regarding mortgage loans on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or disability\n\n- Imposes different terms or conditions on a mortgage loan, such as different interest rates, points, or fees on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or disability\n\n- Discriminates in appraising property on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or disability\n\n- Steers an applicant toward a bad mortgage loan product on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or disability\n\n- Provides inferior servicing of a mortgage loan on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or disability\n\n# Can my bank officer commit lending discrimination?\n\nYes. Any lender, real estate and mortgage broker, appraiser, loan servicer, and title company can commit lending discrimination in any phase of the mortgage loan process. You should report any person, company, or entity attempting to violate your fair lending rights immediately to HUD or a state or local fair housing agency. (Refer to Red Tab, Reporting Lending Discrimination)\_\n\n# When does lending discrimination occur?\n\nWhether you are purchasing or refinancing a home, lending discrimination can occur at any stage of the lending process. For example, if a lender refuses to make a mortgage loan because of your race or ethnicity, or if a lender charges excessive fees to refinance your current mortgage loan based on your race or ethnicity, the lender is in violation of the federal Fair Housing Act.\_\n\n# What are some of the warning signs of lending discrimination?\n\nThe signs of lending discrimination may be blatant or subtle. They can occur in the marketing of mortgage loan products, mortgage loan transactions, terms and conditions of the loan, in the appraisal of a home, and in loan servicing.\n\nIn the marketing of mortgage loan products, be aware of:\n\n- Aggressive solicitations of adverse terms of credit to targeted minority neighborhoods, racial or ethnic groups, and communities\n\n- Racial steering to high cost lenders.\n\n- In the mortgage loan transaction, be aware of:\n\n- Requiring that women, but not men, provide a co-signer for a loan.\n\nIn the terms and conditions of the mortgage loan that are more often imposed upon borrowers of a certain race or nationality or upon women, be aware of:\_\n\n- Unnecessary closing costs\n\n- Inflated appraisal costs\n\n- Inflated broker or lender fees\n\n- Unnecessary recording fees\n\n- Excessive prepayment penalties\n\n- Changing mortgage loan terms at closing without the consent of the borrower.\n\nIn the appraisal of a home, be aware of properties that are undervalued because of the race or nationality of either the borrower or the other residents in the surrounding neighborhood.\n\nIn the servicing of the mortgage loan, be aware of:\n\n- Collection or foreclosure practices applied more harshly because of the race or nationality of either the borrower or the other residents in the surrounding neighborhood."

                          **Prequalification**

                          The Banker collects estimates of your income and liabilities to determine what mortgage products may be available to you and what you can afford to borrow. Our Mortgage Bankers can prequalify you by phone, in some cases. It normally takes 15 to 20 minutes and the applicant will receive a prequalification letter.

                          **Preapproval**

                          This is a more thorough review of your creditworthiness. We verify not only your credit, but also your income, assets and liabilities. Further, you will need to submit documentation such as proof of income, assets and debt records. The process can take 20 minutes if you come prepared, or in some cases up to 2 business days.
