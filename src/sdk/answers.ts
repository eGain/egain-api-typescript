   * @remarks
   * The **Answers API** allows enterprises to deliver fast, accurate, and contextual responses powered by their organizational knowledge. It supports two complementary approaches:
   * <li> **Certified Answers**: Direct snippets retrieved from enterprise-authored content. </li>
   * <li> **Generative Answers**: Natural language responses synthesized by a large language model (LLM).  </li>
   *
   * Every response includes supporting search results, references, and confidence scoresâ€”ensuring transparency, trust, and traceability. The API is built for secure, scalable integration across enterprise environments.
